From case fans, to the Kraken X62, the USB hub and also my Hue devices. I will NEVER invest in NZXT again. As for cases, I will challenge you to show me an updated or older case, which can compete with the Cooler Master Maker 5T. It is almost completely modular, almost entirely with thumb screws, has a psu shroud where the gpu is at least 5&quot; above it, can handle a 280 or 360 AIO and all covers are magnetic instead of screwed down. Space is excellent, as it can handle an atx or eatx mobo, and air flow is superb. All of the pcie rear cover plates are slotted for ventilation, and the top has two areas for ventilation where you can add or remove covers. There is plenty of room and tie-downs for cable management on the rear, and access ports from rear to front. My only complaints about this case are the red color of the inside, and the ridiculous apathy Cooler Master has to providing an updated Face-Plate with USB 3.1 type A &amp; C ports. It would be so easy to do. Outside of that, this is the best case I have EVER used. I look every year to see if there is something better, but every case, INCLUDING the &quot;updated&quot; cases from Cooler Master, fall well short, and are found wanting..."}, {"text": "Didn&#39;t know Star Lord was PC Enthusiast.

I&#39;m using the EKWB XRes 140 combo and their vertical bracket which centers the Reservoir / Pump in front of the 120mm fans on the side.  Be aware that the base of the res is very wide and with a long GPU like the MSI 1080ti, you may not be able to fit.  Just a little more length to the case and also the depth is needed.  Another challenge will be to mount a water cooled GPU since the depth can be no more than 158mm.  Still an awesome case and I haven&#39;t thrown in the towel, I will try to make it work.  If it won&#39;t then I&#39;ll send back to Newegg and buy the S2.  I have 9 fans populated and a 60mm thick 360 radiator in the top for exhaust.
