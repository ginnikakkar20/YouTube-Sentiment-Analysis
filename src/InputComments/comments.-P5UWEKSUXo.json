Anyone making big money with video is using AVID Media Composer or Final Cut Pro, and I am not talking about Youtube&#39;s junk change they give to creators on here. <br /><br />I have the Adobe suite, FCPX and AVID MC and overall my everyday workflow is Blackmagic Resolve for color grading and mask edits and then AVID MC for the NLE creating and rendering of the final project for DVD and Blu-Ray production. I use AVID because it is the most accurate video editor out there, frame by frame you know what you are getting. AVID does requires Multi-Xeon CPUs and ECC memory if you want a smooth workflow without headaches from glitches. It is a higher price to play but wow is it accurate.

And off course if you are serious about color grading, DaVinci is added to  the mix with its own pros and cons. Also if you need to use After Effects for things that you can&#39;t do in Final Cut you still have the same problem. Than off course is the way all these programs handle various footage from various codecs and various bitrates with various effects. Doing a test with a generic &quot;4K video&quot; shows that tests like these can only impress youtube vlogers who don&#39;t do much. If you are shooting Indy film or doing collaboration with other users on various platforms with various cameras and settings for each, this test falls apart in a hurry. Because it really is not a real world test, its a lab experiment that brings in views. Regardless of what you think of the platforms , design of the test does not reveal anything useful for real world production, except maybe light vlog editing for youtube. If you want to test what the title suggests, much of the test needs to be redesigned. Which was the same problem with previous &quot;tests&quot; from other youtubers.

Where is the proof that the Apple is giving you the same quality fo render as Premiere Pro. Perhaps Apple is cutting corners on footage quality. The only pure test would be final cut running on Windows but you cant test that. So the other test you should have done is premiere running on the PC and Mac with the same clips. Stabilisation may be shit in Final Cut - you don&#39;t show us the proof. Warp Stabiliser has been compared LIKE 100 times as being CRAP on the MAC... and also how bad is Final cuts stabiliser - well pretty bad according to reviews out there. So this is not a very objective comparison IMHO. Plus the universal opinion of editors is that Final Cut pro has serious flaws which have excluded it from being used FULL PRO. The BBC got rid of their Macs for this reason. So its a bit like the Volkswagen exhaust situation. Apple are most likely cutting corners to get false results which look good. We need pixel peeping tests and footage robsustness quality comparison after the renders... its the only way. Theres even issues like out of the box ProCC comes with certain super high quality functions which are forced ON which do slow down timeline scrubbing drastically like GPU Accelerated Linear Colour in previews. If you try turning that off see how much better your scrubbing gets ;-)  Also did you know Apple have knobbled Quicktime on PCs to cause problems. Older quicktime versions run smoother than newer ones.... so what fooatage were you trying to give premiere and what wrappers because if quicktime gets involved on a PC and apple are knobbling it slower then theres your problem also!

I never encountered it before"}, {"text": "This is something I keep trying to explain to people, a computer is not all about specs! The purpose of the hardware is solely for the software&#39;s use. Much like an engine for a car. For example; a semi truck engine is much larger and way more powerful than a motorbike, but in its application the truck doesn&#39;t go nearly as fast. Apple has gone through great lengths to remove any bloatcode in their OS, this enables them to use older hardware more efficiently, because that hardware has been tested so extensively. Like a finely tuned motorcycle. Now if you were doing something with lots of CPU based calculations (3D animation for example) then it would lack behind because that task is much more raw calculation. So a workstation with 18 cores would be a 4 core. Pretty simple stuff really. It all comes down to this: what do you need a computer for? If it is mostly editing a video, then Macs are pretty damn good, if it is for CGI work or animation, a higher core PC is better suited."}, {"text": "It&#39;s probably that Final Cut is using the full capabilities of it&#39;s GPU to aid in the export. On several Windows editors, including Premiere, there seems to be relatively little difference in export speed between a GTX 960 and anything above."}, {"text": "Many functions in Premiere aren&#39;t well optimized for multi-core cpus and OpenCL. Warp stabilizer for instance only uses ONE core, which is a joke given that it&#39;s one of the most demanding tasks in the program. However it does have some benefits, one of them being that you have more control over your file structure, you don&#39;t fill up disks with background renders, you don&#39;t have to wait around for the background render to end, and most importantly for me, you can utilize as many monitors as you want. <br /><br />Final Cut X is a sexy piece of software. Sure, it doesn&#39;t play super well with some addons, the background render is both a gift and a curse, it crashes more than Premiere in my experience, especially with plugins, the round-trip to After Effects sucks and the native color grading is much inferior to Premiere&#39;s Lumetri effets. But as mentionned in this video, when it doesn&#39;t crash because of some random plugin, it is smooth as butter. I edited a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-P5UWEKSUXo&amp;t=1m30s\">1:30</a> minute promo clip shot on RED 5&amp;6k on a borrowed 2011 15&quot; Macbook Pro and while it wasn&#39;t perfect, I&#39;m almost positive I wouldn&#39;t have done it as fast in Premiere. To me, Final Cut X is THE BEST video assembly software. The interface is smooth and intuitive and resource management is second to none.<br /><br />However, if you want the most flexible and taylor-fitted NLE, Premiere is the winner. It all comes down to preference.<br /><br />I&#39;ve recently switched from Final Cut X (Hackintosh OS X) to Premiere (Windows) on a 12-core 1366 rig and I&#39;m still preferring Final Cut X. That being said I&#39;ve only been on Premiere for a couple weeks, and as I improve my skills and workflow on this new platform, my opinion may change.<br /><br />Both NLEs are fantastic pieces of code.

Yes, FCPX renders faster than Premiere, but there are video editors for PC that also render just as fast as FCPX. Power Director is an example of that. PD has rendering times almost identical to FCPX, which once again confirms that the &quot;optimization&quot; on Apple&#39;s side is nothing more than their usual marketing BS. And BTW, faster rendering isn&#39;t everything, as FCPX lacks so many professional features, pros haven&#39;t been using it in years. Do you want to know what&#39;s really state-of-the-art? That would be DaVinci RESOLVE. A fantastic editor/color correction suite that, unlike FCPX and Premiere, can harness the power of multiple GPU&#39;s (something impossible in the Apple world. Except for the MacPro, which comes with obsolete GPU&#39;s, making it a moot point.) Try and put 2 or 3 Gtx980ti&#39;s in your PC workstation (NOT in SLI!) and then render in Resolve (the &quot;pro&quot; version, the free version can&#39;t do that.)

Not to mention using the shadow file to help with editing actually downgraded my output quality, so something about CyberLink did not like my PC. I decided on sticking with Sony Movie Studio instead of investing in either CyberLink or Adobe. Granted, the render times were horrible (though, improved through a lot of testing and a little bit of tweaking to about half the time), and the effects are a little underwhelming in some areas. But the ability to scrub through footage is quite good and it&#39;s layout and usability is at just the right area I like for working with. It&#39;s not one of the more raved about editors out there, but it&#39;s one of those things that leads me to believe that not every piece of hardware or software is going to fit each person the same. And this video seems to help explain that. Everybody wants a black &amp; white answer but most things are pretty gray. I would say more on the Mac side of things but I don&#39;t really know so I&#39;ll leave it at, &quot;I ain&#39;t gonna judge!&quot;<br /><br />TL;DR = Good video.

I think both platforms are great and depending on what your workflow is like one will outshine the other.
