The lower the acid content the higher quality oil. I have seen the net results of what was left of confiscated German machine guns that partisan fighters tried storing in vats of olive oil to keep them safe from rust and from the governments that formed after the war.

However, the silk flannel was preserved with the logo embossed in gold. It took me almost a year to restore it into the original condition. It was quite a big box to hold 198 pieces of cutlery in 3 shelves / trays. It had a base with four legs. I showed it to an Antiquarian. He appraised it to be from 1820. He also confirmed that it was made for King, Oscar 1 of Sweden. He also advised me to put it at the State Auction. The highest bid was the equivalent of \u00a310,000. My wife, a Swede, and our daughter, were there. It was a moment that I shall never forget. My daughter, a precocious 13, stopped the bidding and withdrew. She is 37 now. Yep, we still have it. It is filled with my wife&#39;s family heirloom, yes, 198 pieces of silver cutlery from 1893 onward. Each time I look at it, I reminisce my year spent on restoration. I am going to be 80 in June. I wonder who shall be next to restore it. Yes, my friend, restoring is unique and it has its own rewards.
