It still turned out delicious and rose to about double the amount of batter before microwaving. It might be a bit more dense than the cake would be with a leavening agent, but was still pretty fluffy in my opinion.<br /><br />I had a pretty big mug so I didn&#39;t split the recipe into two mugs, I just used one large mug for the entire thing. If you do this you might have some raw batter that the microwave didn&#39;t get to, so when you get to that point you can just pop it back in the microwave for 20-30 secs.<br /><br />I microwaved for 70 secs, but made sure to stop every 30 secs to make sure the cake wouldn&#39;t overcook."}, {"text": "Very entertaining!!!
