Oddly enough, I actually just tossed this case in the dumpster yesterday... well, not EXACTLY this case... I bought this monstrosity from iBuyPower in 2010 in a pre-built (yeah, I don&#39;t do pre-builds anymore... I make them myself these days)... it was both the same and different from this case... the external &quot;jet intakes&quot; were 100% identical, but the internal construction was actually different... I had generic stamped silver metal inside, nothing fancy or blue... and the PSU slot was on the top of the case, not the bottom (as was the norm back in 2010)... nonetheless, the very distinctive outside intakes, side, front and top panel were 100% identical to the case in this review.<br /><br />While this review seemed to give a rather positive spin on this case, I regretted getting this case from day-1. Some things he either didn&#39;t mention or completely glossed over... IT WEIGHS A TON... this case is EXTREMELY HEAVY... way more than it needs to be... i&#39;ve never had a case this heavy before... the front &quot;door&quot; design... while it might look cool when closed, it&#39;s really kind-of annoying when you want to use anything the door covers... want to use the DVD drive? You gotta open the door... want to reset the computer, you gotta open the door... you also need to consider having the room to open the door too, so if you have your case tucked away somewhere, you have to make sure you have &quot;swing room&quot; for the door to open. Airflow in this case is terrible... he mentioned it, but its really bad... just bad. That alone would make me not want to use this case. One final thing I really hated about this case that he didn&#39;t talk about or even mention... those &quot;super cool jet engine&quot; thingies on the sides? Notice they&#39;re on both sides of the case... they include bulges on both side panels and the entire front bezel... this means, no matter which side you lay the case on, you&#39;re always sitting uncomfortably and unstable on bulges that make working on the case nearly impossible as it doesn&#39;t sit flat on any surface. If you want to install or remove anything from inside this case, you&#39;re going to have to remove every panel, including the front to get this case to lay flat... what a huge pain!<br /><br />This review was far too glowing on a really bad case design. I bought this in 2010 and it lasted me as my main computer till 2014, so I had 4 years of experience using this as my main case, and I hated it the entire time. It&#39;s been sitting in my closet for the past 4 years as my &quot;backup, in case something explodes&quot; emergency computer.

I can\u2019t speak for everyone, but I have a PC that was built in late 2011/early 2012 (whatever week Ivy Bridge released in the US), and I used 1 bay for a normal DvDrw, another for a Blu-ray lightscribe rw (oh those laser etched graphics on discs were kick ass, then another bay for a 17 in 5 card reader and some extra front USB, then I popped one of the other two bottom covers off and put 3 really old (like p2 old) cpu fans side by side (I obviously removed the heatsinks) for extra airflow. Wow those fans were tiny. Two came from a dual p2 system where the other cpu went into a pci slot. Definitely looked cool for the time, though the case itself was much more understated, and the door hid the fans. That left one spot empty, which I thought about putting a front midi and eq in for retro games, but never got around to it. The cable management in my case was also ATROCIOUS. Airflow: B+, cables? If you did not have a drill you were screwed. Tiny holes, no space, no gromits, nothing as I think they assumed you\u2019d toss them in one of the 11 total bays; well 14 if you count the 3 ssd which were way too expensive to be feasible for all but the really cool kids then.<br /><br />Oh, side fans.
