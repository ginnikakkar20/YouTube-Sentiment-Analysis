In which case it&#39;s history would be quite unique. As far as I know in general, aluminum riveted aircraft skins were not developed until 1929 in the USA with the one exception of the WWI German Junkers J-1 which did use riveted aluminium. My great uncle flew combat aircraft in WWI. The air frames he was in ( British, French, American, German) weren&#39;t riveted aluminium. I don&#39;t know if he ever flew the Junkers, but he did fly pretty much everything that was flying at the time because one of his jobs was to ferry captured enemy aircraft back to the U.K for assessment. He was also a test pilot. You may suck at welding because you are using a MIG. With an incorrect MIG gas aluminium just won&#39;t weld properly, it must be 100% argon OR 75% argon/25% helium, where as to weld steel the mix is 75% argon/25% carbon dioxide. TIG is the usual choice for aluminium and stainless. What I respectfully suggest is that you acquire a small oxyacetylene set and a micro torch (a jewelers torch), and some low temperature aluminium welding rod. The torch and the rod can be obtained from eBay at VERY reasonable prices. You might also instead acquire a torch known as a &quot;Henrob&quot; torch or as I believe they are now known a &quot;Cobra &quot;torch. It is also a micro torch but is more expensive but will be of much higher quality. It is also more ergonomic in design. With this set up you can cut and weld mild steel, stainless steel, aluminium and other metals. This option is MUCH cheaper than buying a dedicated TIG welder. I&#39;m sure that your friend is aware of all this.....The first time I watched this video I commented that the riveter would make a good planishing hammer because of the hammer head face design. It occurs to me that you certainly have skills and the means to make a selection of hammers for this piece,  in which case the tool will become even more useful as a shaping hammer. It is rather unfortunate however that you polished off the hammer designation and serial numbers."}, {"text": "Belt Wrench is amazing.
