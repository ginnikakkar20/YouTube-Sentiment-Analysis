Assuming you built a desktop to handle it :-)"}, {"text": "give me some money for this plz man"}, {"text": "I just bought a 43 inch Samsung LED Smart tv for my living room gaming"}, {"text": "Dmitri deserves 1m subs, go hardware canucks!!"}, {"text": "I&#39;ve had a 55&quot; 4K OLED since around the time this video was made, it&#39;s awesome!  <br /><br />Things I have learned over the years about gaming on TVs (I&#39;ve been doing it since 2006):<br />1.  Try to find a DVI/PC Mode.  My 40&quot; LED Samsung looked terrible until I found an option to rename the HDMI 1 input to &quot;PC&quot;, this gave perfect 1:1 scaling and the picture was crisp.  In these modes you either can&#39;t use enhancements like 100Hz or the picture becomes very ugly again.  Game mode is supposed to do this but I never got 1:1 scaling.  <br /><br />The other bad thing about this was there was no PC mode on the other 3 HDMI ports so to get 1:1 scaling on all of my HDMI devices I had to get a Hi-Fi receiver that had 4 HDMI ports and output it only to the HDMI 1 port on the TV.  Of course now that I have a 4K TV I need to upgrade again because it is not HDCP 2.2 compliant.<br /><br />2.  HDMI standards must be matched on all of your devices, including your video card (see my first point above).  Some TVs do have DisplayPort (mine doesn&#39;t) but these don&#39;t have the HDCP handshake between your devices so if you plan on watching 4K Blurays in the future you&#39;ll need to run them through a compatible HDMI port.  My TV only has HDMI 2.0, not 2.0a or above, so I can only view HDR content through the USB port or via direct streaming (not an option where I live with my internet speeds).  It&#39;s ironic that the HDCP standard will force me to watch 4K HDR content with pirated movies!<br /><br />As well as the problem with my amplifier not being HDCP 2.2 compliant my GTX 770 only has HDMI 1.4 so I&#39;m not getting a true 4K signal at 60Hz even though both devices report to me that I am.  This is another reason why I am upgrading to a GTX 1080 very soon which has HDMI 2.0b.<br /><br />3.  Just because a TV says it can do 200 or 100 Hz does not mean it will output these framerates with PC games, you&#39;re limited to 60Hz.  I don&#39;t know why this is the case, probably something to do with the image processors and the HDMI standard.  The LG OLED I have has a response time of 0.02ms (no, that&#39;s not a typo!) so it has nothing to do with the screen technology either."}, {"text": "Awesome.

One really important thing if you&#39;re considering gaming on a TV: Test it for latency in the store first. Most tvs have a &quot;game mode&quot; for reduced latency, but even so the latency varies hugely between models. I tried out 8 or so models when I was buying mine, and all but one were usable for fps / mouse driven games. Most tvs are designed for console use, and latency with a controller is far less noticeable than when using a mouse.<br /><br /><br />The way I tested latency was just an informal method where I plugged in my laptop, set the tv to game mode, and moved the mouse around.
