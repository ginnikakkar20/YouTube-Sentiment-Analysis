Using the raster scan to make your film positive is why your lines have irregularities/roughness to them. That will always happen if you don&#39;t use a perfect source, like a properly-made vector file, to make your film positive. You can use a raster program like Gimp or Photoshop too, as long as you recreate the dial&#39;s lettering and lines from scratch (the scan is simply not as good as recreating it from scratch with perfect lines, even if you do clean the scan up) and you do it at at least 600 PPI."}, {"text": "The copper wire was probably the missing space"}, {"text": "MAGAZO!"}, {"text": "Incredibly satisfying!"}, {"text": "Hello from New York City.
