Nothing amazing."}, {"text": "You have to format USB Stick with something that can optimize it to be SSD, not HDD. Because USB can handle chips (like SSD), same as drives (like HDD) or even discs (like ROM), you have to specify what your USB is, how to format it, and based on that format, its gonna be used. NTFS are the worst for USB Sticks, you could get way better from FAT64 and big sectors, but thats big waste of space. Then, you have to tweak your I/O. Standard Windows OS dont have I/O control, so you can experience freezing kind of issues, because something has been transfered, and something else cant (will pause/freeze), until its complete, but because of this I/O throttle, issue will be continuously. Windows Servers have I/O control (so anyone can request data from device thats been used), so it can handle lots of requests, and each one wont wait to get what he is up to, but it cost CPU power, because OS will monitoring everything, and scale throughput based on requests or so. For lots of files and RAID kind of storage (as things that server has to manage at once), its CPU efficient (usually powered by Intel Atom), but on USB with games, I/O control may take 100% of CPU power, things will be smooth, but if that game depends on your specific CPU power, gaming experience will be ruined. So again, not worth gaming on USB Stick.<br /><br />Can you test about SD and gaming? There are micro SD cards with speed up to 95MB/sec, they are not so expensive (low capacity), and cheap converters for micro SD to USB 3 (slim variants usually die at full speed), so you can even make a little RAID with HUB to bottleneck USB port. They doesnt have storage controller chip, so they are gonna be controlled by your MBO (not like USB Stick who got his own controller). Maybe testing in several RAID variants to see the difference. They drain way too low power, doesnt heat at all, got super speed, but storage is a problem (more expensive then SSD/HDD/USB Sticks). Its usually used on Servers for cache (just one of them, where constantly something has to be written, deleted, etc.)."}, {"text": "i am watching on 4k"}, {"text": "does the hyperxstick improves gaming?"}, {"text": "this guy he didn&#39;t show us how we can use usb stick for gaming"}, {"text": "Your saying i can play csgo on any computer i put an and will work?"}, {"text": "Omg.......

Still, their 4K IO speeds hang around 10 to 20 MB/s, in contrast to the 1MB/s 4K speed on the drive used (and this Kingston&#39;s 4K write is more than an order of magnitude slower). Why am I talking about 4K speeds, not sequential speeds, which are what pendrive manufacturers use for their marketing claims? Because Live USB performance depends greatly on reading from and writing to small files, like system libraries and utilities. The only problem with the Sandisk Extreme USB series is that the original line is on the verge of discontinuation, the Extreme Pro line is way too expensive for the size and performance (Sandisk&#39;s portable SSDs and the Samsung Portable SSD T3 are both much better in terms of bang-for-your-buck) and the newer, cheaper Extreme Go line is not far better than competitors in 4K speeds."}, {"text": "this guy looks like chris pratt"}, {"text": "Chris Pratt ?"}, {"text": "HardwareNaCucks"}, {"text": "<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maYuTnci4ys&amp;t=2m37s\">2:37</a> thats how i always play dont worry"}, {"text": "How  about instaling windows on usb  and gaming on hdd,   any problems, stuttering?"}, {"text": "ssd lose vroh."}, {"text": "\u0438\u0434\u0438 \u043d\u0430 \u0445\u0443\u0439"}, {"text": "If i&#39;m not at home so i use my usb-drive 64GB to play WoW on a friends-pc or in some gamingCafe&#39;s too. really easy to do ;D"}, {"text": "Imagine like when youre invited to a Lanparty/ Bootcamp and u dont wanna bring your PC with you, then u juast take the games on the USB STick and Plug\u00b4n\u00b4Play :D Great Portable Game Libary!"}, {"text": "its the internet connection that is the problem. a computer is built to connect to the internet but now instead it has to take data from the drive which might note have the capability to send that much data and collect it back."}, {"text": "subbed cause I saw Transitor"}, {"text": "How are you a cannuck?"}, {"text": "Why&#39;s there a Trabbi on his desk?"}, {"text": "I thought that the whole pc was built in USB."}, {"text": "Who else thought you&#39;re stucked when the CSGO went stuck?"}, {"text": "What camera did you use?

Having obvious advantage of not using space on hard drive, ability to keep saves with a stick and ability to patch game once and it is patched for any system you use it on. It even wouldn&#39;t remove ability to install game and it would install it with latest patch on the drive. And with USB 3.0 speeds, technology wise, we are not limited too much anymore. It is only price wise.<br /><br />Now sure some of those things can be done today too. You could easily do same thing as on video. And steam already backs up your saves to cloud. But still, installation wise and portability wise it would be nice to have this. Since today, games taking 30, 40, 60 or even close to 100GB are not so unusual And it is not a problem if you have fast internet. But not everyone has that. Game on USB drive could solve some of the issues. I could take it to someone with faster internet and have them download update for me. It would provide me with whole game, not like for example Fallout 4 where you get only part of the game on disc, rest is downloaded, even if you buy it on disc.<br /><br />Not to mention lower need for hard drive space. Because you don&#39;t buy 500GB or 1TB or even bigger hard drive just for your programs and movies. At least on my end, most of it is used by games.<br /><br />And it would add save portability on games where you don&#39;t have it. Sure Steam has it. But GoG for example doesn&#39;t. And while I don&#39;t blame GoG. Maintaining such cloud is expensive, it is still awesome feature I would love to see. I can&#39;t even count how many times I had to restart game, because I lost files with new Windows installation.<br /><br />I even tested few games by running them on USB 2.0 external drive and while loading times were long, a lot of them performed just fine, as long as everything they needed was in RAM.

The only glaring issue is that it lacks garbage collection, so you have to zero out the drive from time to time to keep up write performance.<br /><br />As for the future, I don&#39;t think Gen 2 will really improve things. USB 3.0 can already transfer at around 450MB/s no problem, yet we rarely see USB flash drives actually going that fast. It&#39;s a matter of having a good storage controller, not a limit of the USB connection. There are drives from Corsair that are pretty much just regular SSD&#39;s on a stick, and those are the only ones that will actually benefit from a Gen 2 upgrade. Your best bet is to get something like the Samsung USB SSD or a regular SSD in an enclosure, as that will ensure a good experience no matter what you do with it.<br /><br />EDIT: I also just figured out that the Sandisk Cruzer Extreme 3.0 is actually a Sandisk U100 SSD stuck in a flashdrive with a SATA to USB3 adapter built in."}, {"text": "Why put Steam on the USB?
