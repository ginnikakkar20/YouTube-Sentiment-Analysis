ATI and Nvidia were locked in a battle for the best video cards and Intel and AMD were doing the same with processors.  There was always something new and great coming out. We were getting huge upgrades every few months.  <br /><br />I\u2019ve seen comments where many people ask \u201cWhy should I care about AMD?\u201d We need the competition. Intel got caught paying computer companies to not use AMD processors a few years back.  They got fined for it, but AMD has taken years to recover. Once AMD was out of the picture,  the pace of innovation slowed down considerably.  We need two major companies producing video cards and processors. At this point, we won\u2019t be seeing new products like we were in the \u201890s and the \u201800s but hopefully we will see some competition in price and new features.
