So I&#39;d have to include the cost of a window and the veterinary bill of removing the file from the neighbour&#39;s cat&#39;s leg or something where it ended up. :D<br /><br />One question, on the finished object mirror side I see straight lines in the finish... why not use the age old mini circle technique of final polish?
