A small note - because I don&#39;t like cream cheese, I put 100 gr. less cream cheese (and replaced half of the other with mascarpone). I ended putting the whole 150 gr dulce de leche to make the cheese cake sweet enough. Which is to say that with the whole quantity of cream cheese, the cake probably would lack sweetness. Of course, I was too lazy to make the almond thing so I just used chopped walnuts for the crunchiness. So just saying, people, check the sweetness of your filling before pouring it in. Also, in my case, it ended up being a bit liquid, due to the missing cream cheese.

But I&#39;m already thinking about an ice cream cheese cake instead of a normal cake. Dulce de leche is the same as condensed milk, so I think I will make an ice cream base using whipping cream and dulce de leche, and add the cream cheese as a flavoring agent. So it will be a cream cheese dulce de leche ice cream. And then follow your recipe and instead of popping it in the fridge, I will pop it in the freezer. I want to make some more ice cream after the first try of your perfect no-machine ice cream recipe.<br /><br />And dulce de leche is way cheaper than sweetened condensed milk in Norway. We can buy plain dulce de leche as a bread spread, named HaP\u00e5, for half the price of a can of sweetened condensed milk.
