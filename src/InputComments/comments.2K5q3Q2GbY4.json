I have a question though if you don&#39;t mind. Do you use any pedals during this song? For instance in m3 to m4. I get the feeling that if I don&#39;t sustain the A, that it ends to abrupt before I can make the switch to the BEC chord(LH). Maybe it&#39;s just because i&#39;m practicing at a really slow speed and I don&#39;t make the switch fast enough. But do you have any tips on the pedals, do you use any?
