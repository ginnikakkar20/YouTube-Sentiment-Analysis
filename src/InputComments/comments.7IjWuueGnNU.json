For instance, at the beginning (matching your version between 1&#39;22&#39;&#39; and 1&#39;40&quot; approximatively), the right hand repeats itself ; that much i can understand, and it&#39;s absolutely gorgeous but i&#39;m utterly unable to find out how the hell he is playing with the left hand at the same time. Poor hearing, and poor me too ;)<br />Well, would you be kind enough to enlighten me, if you&#39;re able to ? That would be really, really great !!<br />Anyways, thank you for everything, and i&#39;m looking forward to having good news from you (well, maybe).<br />Sincerely yours,<br />Nervi"}, {"text": "This is by far the best piano tutorial for the song I&#39;ve ever seen!
