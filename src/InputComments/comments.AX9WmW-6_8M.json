Lovely playing. I am more of a jazz player, but &quot;classical&quot; music is my true love. So with that in mind I decided to work on my &quot;legit chops. I picked this Prelude to start working on, as well as Hanon exercises. My problem is the last 3 chords. I have very small hands (an octave span), and I can&#39;t play the chords as written. Any suggestions? I can leave the bottom octave out, but it loses something. The last chord I can play the lower octave (left hand) as is, and not play the root with my right and still play the rest of the chord.Note: I can play the 9th as long as I don&#39;t have to play anything with my middle fingers... I hope some of this makes sense."}, {"text": "Jane, can you please send me a link to your PRELUDE IN E MINOR BWV 941 by Bach.
