Screw fixing the soldering tip will probably not whitstand hammering, that&#39;s why it was not used originally.<br /><br />Overall: perfect job, good to put this soldering iron to collection.

The pure level of craftsmanship, genius and care that goes into every single one of them is insane. <br /><br />I don&#39;t like badmouthing other channels, but way too many &quot;restoration&quot; channels out there don&#39;t really care about the item they&#39;re restoring. They take out some parts, wash them quickly, splash some fancy new paint on it and done to never be seen again, next one.<br /><br />This guy goes so far above and beyond. He cares about and takes care of literally EVERYTHING. He takes appart his items down to the very last oh so little part and inspects and works on them with a level of skill, care and passion that that is unrivaled. He has the ability to breave new life into items that seem completely lost and broken. And if a part is broken beyond repair, he has the knowledge, craftsmanship and tools to make a replacement which isn&#39;t anything short of perfection. And the way he carefully inspects, cleans and polishes everything down to the last screw is truely a sight to behold of. It&#39;s one thing to give a rosted old item a shiny new look. It&#39;s a completely different level to understand the inner nature and little quirks of said item, getting its mechanics right and restoring it back to its original functionality, keeping the original spirit of the item alive while adding some personal and shiny new touch. And this guy completely nails it every goddam time. I also love the fact he actively uses some of his restorations in future works, they don&#39;t just vanish into a corner to be forgoten again. <br /><br />The video editing shouldn&#39;t go unmentioned either. Video editing is a craft in itself, and he is an absolute master at it too. Every step he takes gets documented properly, nothing is skipped or cut out. But he also doesn&#39;t strech things out unnescecarely to the point it gets boring. The camera angles and lighting are always on point, it&#39;s like you&#39;re watching from his perspective. There is no annoying or bs  narration or music, just straight to the point with only the lovely sound of machines doing their work in the background. I think the fact you can watch a 20+ min video of a guy tinkering with his stuff without any narration or music and not be bored one sec, but rather amazed, speaks for itself. <br /><br />As a fellow Swiss I can only give my depest respect and admiration to you, humble and talented sir.

A coat of red paint and white touch up on the letters and they look better than new. I posted a picture on my social media and I had three people offered to buy them outright.
