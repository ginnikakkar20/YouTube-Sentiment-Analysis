And removing the cast marks was a nice touch as well!<br /><br />I also love how you always remake damaged, unsalvageable parts from scratch. Machining tiny screws is always a joy to watch.<br /><br />Great choice of colors for the paintjob - yellow, black and red (the rear glass part) work really well together. Probably inspired by TysyTube&#39;s orange and black which is also a pretty nice choice of colors, but I think orange is a little to close to red of the glass so the overall result ends up having less contrast. <br /><br />You also painted the text black which is really nice accent and ads further contrast. <br /><br />I almost forgot to mention the last and most important part - I love the way you shoot videos - not only you know your craft as far as restorations go, but you also know how to shoot and edit video expertly. Every part of the process is extremely clear, the cuts are well timed and deliberate. You often go in real close to show the details but you always show the big picture first, so the viewers always know what they&#39;re looking at. As for the audio side of things It&#39;s as good as you can make it with what you have. It&#39;s really not an issue at all, but I said it before and I&#39;ll say it again - having a better microphone would turn the quality up to 11. Also an external mic wouldn&#39;t pick up camera&#39;s autofocus. <br /><br />Last time I suggested an digital field recorder but now I&#39;m not so sure it would be a good solution - it would be a chore syncing it to the footage for every shot since the audio and video would be on separate devices. A better solution would be an external microphone plugged into the camera directly. Sadly your camera does not have a microphone input so there&#39;s not much that can be done short of buying a whole new camera which is ridiculous. Still if you ever decide to buy a new one you should definitely look for one that supports external microphones.<br /><br />Oh and btw how&#39;s the sandblaster switch doing? :P"}, {"text": "You need to sell shirts that say &quot;I make a new one&quot;"}, {"text": "Just subbed great video"}, {"text": "Du bist  wirklich der beste !!

He would have been better off taking this old version and making a brand new lamp, cause that is basically what he did. Actually he made it better than new, cause the new version was not flat or smooth.  It had the cast marks and such. The workers who used the lamp likely did not care. I mean his workmanship is great, his lathe and mill work fine. But this lamp looks nothing like the original. The is very little of the original patina and history that made this tool look great. Enjoy them for what they are tools. When they were made they were not made to be show pieces.  You take beautiful old tools and ruin them. Kind of like us humans being 70 years old and then having plastic surgery to be 30 again. We may look new but we have no wear marks that prove we have worked and lived a great life.

I say this cause of the distance you hold your nozzle, a good flow should start giving a finish at about 8 inches or more. 40 psi with 60 grit will do an awsome job. 60 psi is better but strong enough to really remove metal if held in place. A powdery finish usually indicates old sand. Use rubber or vinyl tape to cover spots you dont wanna blast. Put a rubber mat in the bottom of your blaster. Itll prolong the life of the bed. I work on aerospace parts. Alot harder metal than this like inconel 625, cobalt, stainless, titanium. We cast weld inspect and finish all in one building for GE engines. AS9100 certified. Just a few tips but your grit blaster could be completely different we have many and they all have little kinks. Also get a dyna file by dynabrade.
