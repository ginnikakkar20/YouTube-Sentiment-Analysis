It is 57-90% fructose making much worse than High Fructose Corn Syrup which is only 55% fructose.  I am sure it is possible to buy Agave processed by artisanal companies in small batches using cold process methods but the vast majority of Agave in the US is highly over processed and very unhealthy.

Dr. Andrew Weil stopped using Agave sweeter in 2011 according too is own website because of the fructose content."}, {"text": "amazing video"}, {"text": "is there any replacement for the kiwi? cause i&#39;m allergic\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d"}, {"text": "Back at it again with fruit popsicles, love all the popsicles that you make"}, {"text": "Heyy Gemma, these popsicles are way too pretty.
