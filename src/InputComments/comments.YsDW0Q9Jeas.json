I think some of that gap around the PSU would have been filled up with the 24 pin if you were using a different ITX board - the placement of the 24 pin of that MSI is a little weird, so the cable is pulled further round.

It&#39;s only a bit bigger (not that much though maybe 10-20mm in any given direction) but it can fit a slim load Optical and a 3.5inch drive (although I think you can&#39;t use both of these at the same time). It also looks better if you ask me. Can also fit quite a bit bigger coolers in it so you can fit pretty beefy heatsinks in that thing if you want.
