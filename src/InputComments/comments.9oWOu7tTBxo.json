It&#39;s open to allow the fuel to flame up and over the upper main flame chamber (to pre-heat it). Once most of the fuel in the open reservoir has burned off (about 3-5 minutes), the upper main chamber/tube should be hot enough to use. Turn the knob to start the flame (it should self ignite). If it doesn&#39;t, just use a stone igniter or zippo/lighter. In about 1-2 minutes the main flame will go from orange to blue. That is when it&#39;s ready to use. Then adjust the knob to get the size flame you need. You can also open the knob a little bit during the preheating phase to help speed things up a bit.

Ein kleiner Verbesserungsvorschlag zu deinen Videos: Es w\u00e4r interessant zu wissen was du in den einzelnen Schnitten denkst/sagen/machen willst/etc. Aber nicht vertont, oder als Untertitel im Video direkt, sondern es reicht wenn du die Youtube-Untertitel dazu benutzt, sodass diejenigen die sich daf\u00fcr interessieren, es einschalten k\u00f6nnen.<br /><br />So ersparst du dir den Text in der Videobeschreibung und mehr Leute werden es sehen. bzw. diejenigen die nicht auf dem PC gucken, sondern im Vollbild, oder TV, k\u00f6nnen es dann auch lesen.<br /><br />Ein Beispiel: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVV4xeWBIxE\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVV4xeWBIxE</a> <br />Primitive Technologys Untertitel. <br /><br />Keep up the good work!"}, {"text": "You&#39;re just as talented as a storyteller as you are a craftsman.

The thruster section, a empty CO2 bottle with a removable brass gas jet at the rear of the capsule was loaded with white gas. Just like your torch there was a gas prompter dish which was loaded with a wick soaked in white gas which was clipped onto the CO2 bottle with stiff wire that held it below the CO2 bottle. The &quot;jet engine&quot; was suspended from a string.  The prompter dish was lit which heated the gas in the CO2 bottle causing it to get hot, ignite and cause the bottle to spin. It was sold as a model engine, but was never installed on any of my model airplanes."}, {"text": "To make it complete you need to get wick material that fits into the up tube portion of the  start up pan on the bottom, and only enough to pull the small amount of fuel you place into the pan (just enough the soak the wick and not completely flood the pan) so it directs the flame up to the torch tip and does not send flame up at the valve assembly section from the main pan, that is what is causing the sputtering and unstable flame, too much heat in the rear valve assembly area."}, {"text": "Thank you for another beautifully done restoration!
