That&#39;s why often headphones with built in surround-soundcards perform way better in this regard than normal headphones. <br />I have a relative expensive stereo headphone connected(200 bucks) to a high end gaming soundcard, but the virtual surround is nowhere as good as my relative cheap Surround sound gaming-headset, which is tested to the last bit for surround sound in mind."}, {"text": "The human ear can only hear 30 beats per second so it really doesnt matter"}, {"text": "Fantastic views"}, {"text": "oh yeah yeah"}, {"text": "I\u2019m a huge audiophile and really loved this video.

He says that all gaming headsets are crap. Well, the sound for music isn&#39;t the best on most of them for sure. I&#39;ve been using Sound BlasterX H7 for awhile now. They are far more comfortable than any earphones I tried, even with glasses on. Never had anyone complain about mic quality. Did some sound recording on my own to test it, and it wasn&#39;t studio quality. It was easy to hear and understand what was being said, though. The goal is to be heard and understood. I really CAN hear things with a more clear direction sense on the H7 headset than the regular headphones I tried. I know, &#39;real&#39; headphones can do the same things. They mostly don&#39;t though. <br /><br />Surround is seems to be half gimmick. I only hear 4 actual positions. I&#39;ve been in homes with surround sound, and you can def hear all 5 stations if they run a demo. <br /><br />For music, def get regular headphones. SOME gaming headsets are just marketing, but some really do provide benefit. Durability has been an issue with people that are rough on their stuff since they made something other than the ones you used to have to use in elementary school to listen to a record player. Those dang headphones would be around after a bomb blast. I mean, they gotta be tough if they are going to survive multiple school years, right? Children are roughhhh on things.<br /><br />Either way, if you&#39;re spending a significant amount of money, it is probably worth your time to check out some stores that have models hooked up for demo. Even if the headphones/headset is the most super awesome quality, it might be very uncomfortable for you to wear.  I did see that Audeze has a &#39;gaming&#39; headset now.

When you sit in the living room, surround sound is amazing because slight movement of your head establishes (pinpoint) the surround effect.  In a lounge 5.1 setup, the time between the sound takes to go in one the go in the other ear is what makes us recognise if the sound is from the the front or the back. The brain recognises as we turn our head the direction of the first sound is from the more forward ear.<br />In multi driver headphones this, does not happen as the drivers move as you turn your head with your head. The effect must occur between both your ears, and for this a virtual 7.1 surround can simulate this effect pretty amazingly.<br />7.1 virtual surround works great, especially if it well implemented. Sound algorithms can trick our brains into hearing various directions very well.<br />I just wanted to elaborate why I think physical multi driver 5.1 or 7.1 solutions don&#39;t work at all. When you have only two ears, blasting the ear from a driver a little more forward is not what makes it hear it from the front. Our ears are not omnidirectional, they work out direction based on delay between the (only) 2 directions."}, {"text": "Phillips fidelio x2. <br /><br />These things sound great, are open back, and SUPER COMFY."}, {"text": "Yet to hear better than Turtle Beach Stealth 520 wireless."}, {"text": "this guy is the dollar store Chris Pratt"}, {"text": "You call it surround sound, back in the 70&#39;s we called it Kunstkopf binaural sound created by the ZBS Foundation.

Turns our, your ears CANNOT tell the difference between speakers position at such a close proximity to the ear canal.

So, there is a sweet spot in distance from the ears in which you can actually pick up the difference in speaker position with your ears.<br /><br />So, this study proved for a fact that virtual surround sound is literally the only way that you can make surround sound headphones work. I&#39;ve owned multiple &quot;real surround sound&quot; headphones before, including Asto&#39;s and Turtlebeach headphones.

The sound locations were SPOT ON, not only that the actual sound clarity, and definition was totally extreme compared to anything I have ever heard!<br /><br /> I read this study after I purchased these headphones so it had no input into my decision. The key point to take away here is if we buy them, they will make them. But it doesn&#39;t mean we need them, or if they even work.

Not only do many good applications have quality equalizers, but there&#39;s strong evidence to prove that there&#39;s a certain amount of &quot;correction&quot; our mind will do over time; e.g. the more you use a a pair of headphones the less you will notice how good or bad they are (unless they are exceptionally so).<br /><br />And so the big things, to me, are as follows<br />1. Instrument separation. With a really good instrument separation you can hear things you may not have heard before (i.e. good instrument separation in the low ends makes a noticeable difference in Hans Zimmer&#39;s works. He tends to blend live orchestra recording with synthesized audio and he does so so well that you may not hear it with &quot;average&quot; cans.)<br /><br />2. &quot;Tight&quot; bass. This is a pretty ambiguous term and everyone has different meaning for it, but suffice to say your bass is no good if it kinda &quot;goos&quot; around and you lose all sense of when a note starts and ends. Again if a headphone is lacking bass you can crank it up, but if your bass has poor control then there&#39;s not much you can do about it without some major mp3 coloring BS<br /><br />3. Sound stage. This is less about one soundstage being better than the other and more about what you personally like. I remember when I first tried out some audio technica headphones and noticed how much wider it was compared to everything else I had used before and I really liked it, but that&#39;s not for everyone and they certainly make pairs that have a wider soundstage than i find comfortable. Finding the sound stage you like is basically the cherry and whip cream on a great sundae.<br /><br />Of course most of this is geared towards music, but I&#39;m far more interested in the quality of my music than the quality of the sound in my games."}, {"text": "What I\u2019ve learn is that a non-gaming headset are really good when you listen to music and a gaming headset the bass is just way higher so it might not sound good"}, {"text": "What I\u2019ve learn is that a non-gaming headset are really good when you listen to music and a gaming headset the bass is just way higher so it might not sound good"}, {"text": "I don&#39;t know, I perfer non-gaming headphones but I once bought a $13 pair of gaming headphones and sounded better in almost every aspect then a $60 pair seinheiser."}, {"text": "en el caso de consolas es igual? por q no puedo conectar un micr\u00f3fono a mi xbox one y tengo unos beats pero no funcionan para hablar, pese q tienen mic"}, {"text": "audio technica 900x"}, {"text": "Did you try the ossic x headphones \ud83c\udfa7 for gaming?"}, {"text": "I used the sony pulse elites they were $160 when i got it now i seen them for $80 if you cam find then at all but man those were the best i ever had before they broke week hinges holding the speakers.

I have had Tritton, Sony and even Bose headphones, but none compare to the quality of the J55a by JBL. It does not have a built in mic, so it isn&#39;t a gaming headset per se. You would need to get a separate mic (and I picked up an NW800 condenser mic for that). <br /><br />Imho, a lot of gaming headsets are overhyped and do not have good sound quality or a good harmonization of frequency that Dimitri was talking about. I think it is ok to go for them if you want them for convenience and at a deep discount on the original price - a rare but possible occurrence. <br /><br />Otherwise, choose carefully what you want and never overpay. <br /><br />Look for higher impedence (higher than your basic 16-18 ohms) for more controlled driver sounds, and ensure you have an understanding of the balancing of the Bass/Mids/Treble/highs, and as Dimitri said, anything that has open backs for each ear cup is going to be better sounding, generally.

Audio Engineering Background, and to put it bluntly there area a lot of phasing issues, and much more with just sticking a bunch of drivers and routing it in a small headset for reasons I,m guessing you know and maybe some you don&#39;t.  I have the best In ear custom fit monitors money can buy with a tone of drivers in a small package, but it is also stereo, and incredibly engineered through multiple actual opening in what are also very intensely engineered  phase perfect, and extremely advanced crossovers Hence costing 2000 dollars but it fits only my ears and prevents deafness(if you don&#39;t jack the volume up as in, being monitors but the most coherent sounding and precise audio I&#39;ve yet heard.  And they have  shit ton of head room and adjustable bass roll off which I like to set for neutral and four bass drivers 2 mids, 2 highs, again for headroom and clarity and placement because  bass drivers in the form of the in ear monitors but just orgasmic very absurdly well depth and spread beyond the best open ear headphones or any speakers I&#39;ve ever listened to. I&quot;m using term spread becasue you probably know what I mean and maybe if I refereed to the technical aural spacing I&#39;d have to give a more detailed explanation, that might not make sense to most viewers though, I am Perfectly willing to break down complex concepts.  So you are right.  My monitors are stereo, and frankly more precise as I like to have them frequency flat as possible.  IE each monitor has 8 drivers, four for down low and then for a total of 8 crystal clear rousted with extreme math through three separate pefect phase coherency hole from the shell into perfect fit in my ear to take care of the ultra advanced crossovers and geometry etc, that no other monitors or headphones come close to or speakers.  The three holes in ear combines the sound back in synergy based on various frequencies to further avoid fazing issues, and The four bass drivers are again for headroom, form me and I have a bass adjustable toggle but I set it to neutral or less slightly to compensate for clarity as since everything is so microscopic inside in components again the four bass drivers and insane amount of headroom without even using a decent headphone amp is really the reason for the four bass drivers in each ear(not technically drivers proper), for clarity, Clarity as obviously bass frequencies use up much more headroom and 4 independent drivers crammed into each monitor for a total of 16 speakers between to ears and the flexibility with bass adjustment again I like to stay as flat as I can in overall frequency response as possible and be analytical and hear exactly as things are unadulterated, there are more technically flat frequency response monitors of the same brand, specifically only as analytical monitors but having fewer drivers, six per ear,  if not noticeable to most there is ever so slightly more distortion because the 4 bass drivers per ear and then other two in practice on mine have a much more advanced, truly incredible crossover system so the bass drivers and all the headroom sand even a headphone amp which makes things much much more precise aren&#39;t to boost bass frequencies so much as get good clear separation.  And Also as extremely flat frequency response as one can get unless you mess with the low frequency/bass adjustment knob, For pleasure listening? To boost or any basically neutral adjustments needing to be made.  They go down to 5hz with very little decibel roll off and quite far above 20khz.  Since low frequency takes very much  power and I have some instruments spanning as low as 15-18 hz for lowest note, just out of practicality in the case of my 7 string sub contra bass, and most speakers especially as they get bigger and lowder and less precise with crossover and all that jazz,  I literally Sadly Can only even really hear the fundamental frequencies of sub contra bass I made on The monitors.  Everything else is just higher harmonics as far as speakers go.  Same with guitar Of great range and much more.  I&#39;ve tried to design my own amplification for sub contra bass etc.... as most speakers including subs for reasons Im guessing you are aware of would require extreme engineering beyond my capabilities, and absurd amount power to say cleanly reproduce Just moderate notes I Guess stuff people can&#39;t hear increasingly below 250hz. And the bass goes up way higher.... So it&#39;s a nightmare and Literally I have loooked and there isn&#39;t amplification and technology I&#39;m  Aware of of that could halde the range of frequencies clearly, even with a shitload of headrooom without terrible issues.   And I don&#39;t have things like a bass that bottoms out below what people are supposed to be able to comprehend or hear, that they can;t because of inadequate technology properly.   I mean 50 hz willl stress bass speakers and even subs, and subs go down to 30 Generally but the decibel level takes as drastic hit anywhere close in otherwords, Bad clipping and distorion  and innacurate reproduction of such frequencies as they are properly existent in the context of the subcontrabass itself say.<br /><br />So Not that Anyone Can Afford 2500+ custom fit abusrdly advanced in ear monitors like mine but, they are so perfect than can handle a shit storm of even retarded low bass spamming abuse below what people can generally hear, and a hell of a lot more extremely articulately.   <br /><br />So to prove your point I Can&#39;t Imagine Using those with the 7.1 standards, or anything else for virtual surround as they are THE ultimate stereo In ear monitors in terms of what they can handle and their imaging, in this case stereo, and actually far stronger and clearer with noise being spammed than any gaming headphone LOL and probably any speakers or headphones, so with the right virtual simulation of surround, take your pick, and a separate mic the stereo imaging and capabilities are so exceptional, I can&#39;t imagine the actual fidelity and immersion, vs even really good head cans using the same idea You pointed out well vs trashy gaming cans generally.....   My Guess is that While setting it up would be a little more haste than buying The most expensive delux wireless headphones out there that are plug and play, not that much harder other than a few technical drawbacks and lots of wires the former of which I could fix fairly easily, that latter,  obviously Would be a little messy and I might have to do some interesting things, but getting it to work, I naturally have such exceptional hearing and plus my crazy in ear monitors I have being a muscian and valuing my hearing,  most games would sound kind of fucked up and broken and extremely unpolished at that level of fidelity and analytical hearing. I&#39;d have an extremely unfair advantage over any gaming headset mic combo to the level that if there is actually scrited sound, and player noise of any sort, I would be able to hear say an entire enemy team across the entire level and track 24 individuals tip toeing as far as the sound is allowed to propagate in the game. It actually would be really unfair in say some battle field maps as surround helps in that but I would be able to basically see them through walls potentially the entire level depending on the level of audio quality, and accurate sound design modeling on part of designer because walking I would easily be able to pick out every person in the match and gun fire literally would light up where an entire enemy team is based on wave propagation with the limit being basically the limits of the programing and audio production.  I but the surround would basically let me see through walls and blind spots without vision and gunfire for instance would light up where everything is like a fucking Russian radar and missile battery would light up an f-35 lightening squad  using extremely advanced low frequency passive distributed radar arrays, many other types of radar that would do the lighting far in advance of an f-35 just with the triumph, as well radar lock can&#39;t necessarily be achieved  via low band passive radar arrays, they will show up at a range exceeding even the American Avionics unless they wanna resort to AWAKS and Jamming etc LOL which may or may not work.  They&#39;d be detected as anomalous, it&#39;s not that hard with stealth.  The SR-71 Blackbids had to be retired because the soviets knew hours in advance from support to get the aircraft up and going where they were gonna be, and the mig 31&#39;s were just about as fast with exceptional radar ahead of it;s time and, with missile armament and Kinetic performance, at very high altitude, An Sr-71 could realize they are violating airspace, turn around and not outrun the Migs if they actually wanted to shoot them down, Because of the high altitude more or less most advanced radar and avionics for an interceptor role at the time that It is still increadibly effective Today in mig 31 as they could fly Close to as fast as Sr-71 and were also a part of soviet and now russian very brilliant and extremely unpleasant radar and area denial layering that is improving to shoot down Intercontinental ballistic misfiles and actually on schedule and effective and that is operational unlike American missile defense failures but operates as just surface to air area denial, so the most recent version with two more in the works can shoot down just about anything, including hyper sonic cruise missiles and  all sorts of ballistic missiles. Probably any enemy aircraft or artillery shells  in the layered nature.  The Triumph can shoot down satellites and and all manor of threats including ballistic missiles I hundreds of miles away high in the atmosphere and it works actually works.  But it is deployed like any other surface to air system,  with layers of misery.   With Integrated, Infrared, radar avionics,  defensively I don&#39;t think A b-2 would be safe NOW, as low band radar says it is there, and plane uses IR/fusion to lock heat...."}, {"text": "Is steelseris Siberia better than hyper x? \ud83d\ude02"}, {"text": "Anyone here use Audio Technica ATH M50x for gaming?

Razer Tiamat 7.1 v2 is a costly true surround headset. It is comfortable, looks cool, and provides with good spatial awareness because of the 7.1 stuff going on.<br /><br />Gaming with it on feels great. And then you try to listen to some music, and it&#39;s crap - a $200 headset that sounds a lot worse than my $15 AmazonBasics headset.<br /><br />Thing is, with music you deal with a single pre-mastered track. In better scenarios, it&#39;s already fine-tuned to sound as good as your equipment will allow it. In games, there&#39;s a lot of overlaying sounds with visual feedback. Instead of &quot;observing the flow of sound&quot;, you react to things. You may not be able to hear the overtones of the sound of a gunshot, but you will hear it and you will recognize it as one, and your imagination will fill in the rest - because you don&#39;t have time to thoroughly analyze it, you have to react.<br /><br />This is an important concept in game design - realism vs. believability. What gaming headsets need to achieve is the believability of a sound, not necessarily the realism. Also, the headphone should be able to reproduce dozens of overlaid sounds without distorting or turning those into noise.<br /><br />Gamers, moreso on the competitive scene, sometimes dial down the graphics to gain an increase in visual fidelity and simplicity.<br /><br />Add the pretty valid argument about comfort during prolonged use and the usual &quot;my rig looks shinier and cooler than yours&quot; vanity, and you got a good gaming headset.

Is all this information is still actual for now?<br /><br />I&#39;m choosing between gaming headsets with external usb-card:<br />Razer Kraken 7.1 v2<br />Razer ManO&#39;War 7.1<br />HyperX Cloud Revoler S<br />HyperX Cloud II<br />Logitech G933<br /><br />And non-gaming headsets:<br /><br />Beyerdynamics DT 770 \\ 880<br />Sennheiser HD 600<br />Audio-Technica ath-ad900x<br /><br />The mein problem for me is that audiophile headsets need DAC and amplifier for good sound. As I understand, all creative technologies that was used for X-Fi series are not actual because in Windows 10 all sound detalization is depends on game and sound &quot;engine&quot; that used in it. ASUS coundcards like STX, Phoebus and other are used only for amplifying, because they don&#39;t have good DAC for gaming, may be it suits only for audiophiles&#39; music listening. Many ASUS users say that their soundcards are good for gaming, but I guess they sait it because didn&#39;t heard creative&#39;s sound.<br /><br />Why I can&#39;t buy stx \\ phoebus or X-Fi titanium hd? ASUS have troubles with drivers for Win10: STX have buggy sound, Phoebus doesn&#39;t no more support. Creative&#39;s best card X-Fi Titanium HD use custom sound drivers, they do work on Win10, but soundcard doesn&#39;t have a pre-amp, so DT 770 \\ 880 with impedence more then 32om will not be burned. Adding point that the sound is processed by the game engine and as a result there is no point to buy X-Fi.<br /><br />When I summarazied all info about soundcards I got stucked. What shall I do?!? I got lost....<br /><br />So I came to idea that only Creative Sound BlasterX AE-5 worth buying because of built-in DAC, amplifier, good software &quot;for gaming&quot; but is costs abou $180. But it really gives good advantage for super natural surround sound. All users that switched to this card from any others: creative zxr, creative X-Fi Titanium HD, Asus xonar dx\\dg and so on - mentioned that sound it terrific. Again, there are no sound test on youtube, only forum messages from cards&#39; owners.<br /><br />The other side I haven&#39;t seen any reviews of new gaming headsets from audiophiles. All reviews are written mostly for marketing. They don&#39;t provide amplitude frequency response,  they don&#39;t say about dependence between impedance and sensitivity. There is totally no any other info. All I know i that HyperX headsets are based on Taskstar 80\\82 series. I talked to users of Taskstarts and they say two things:<br />1. HyperX analog headsets soundd a little bith worse then Taskstar<br />2. Taskstar headphones have worse soundstage then hd 660 \\ dt 700 \\ ad900x<br /><br />So for me gaming headsets are like Shroedinger `s cat: reviews say that they awesome but there is no addition information why.<br /><br />My question is: Do audiophile headset $200 + Creative AE-5 $180 will worth buying for true-gaming or new 2017 year headsets will be good enough?"}, {"text": "Personally, I find my music headphones don&#39;t cut it at all for gaming.

With a higher ohm rate, the G5 does a great job keeping volume levels very high. The bass is tight, pronounced, and doesn&#39;t bleed into the mids. The treble is verrrry slightly muted, but I add the Crystallizer setting on the soundcard to about 45% and that rounds it off nicely. I also have the Antlion attached microphone.<br />I used to use the Sennheiser PC 363D. It had an EXCELLENT USB dongle for virtual surround, and the drivers and microphone are FANTASTIC. The GAME1 is the newer version of that headphone, and I would recommend it.<br />For the best sound stage, I recommend the AKG Q701, or AKG K702 (~$240). They have the widest sound separation that I&#39;ve heard. The highs are crisp and clean, but it does lack a little bit in the bass department. However, they are really good for gaming.<br />The next on my list are the MrSpeakers Alpha Dogs. They are planar magnetic headphones and require a LOT of power to run. Thankfully, the G5 can still give the juice for them. The treble is very crisp, with faster bass than the HD650 but not as prominent. Overall, I love these headphones for gaming, but I find myself enjoying the open back advantage with the HD650.<br />I have used many gaming headphones, but I just can&#39;t recommend them (Logitech, Razer, Tritton, and Turtle Beach. NEVER, ever buy Turtle Beach). If you want even a smaller budget headphone, the Logitech G930 are good, but old. Also, I would recommend Steelseries Siberia. However, plug in another $100 - $150 and you will have a MUCH better headphone set for gaming.<br />Finally, if you opt for the Steelseries price range, it may be better to bump up a LITTLE BIT and opt for the AudioTechnica ATh-M50 and the Antlion microphone."}, {"text": "I owned the Tritton Katana HD for one week and I was disappointed with its sound.

I&#39;m slightly exaggerating, I used a generic 5 Chanel surround audio test to make the frequency as flat as possible, 360 degrees of flat frequency, completely muted chat, disconnected the mic, then the Dolby headphone algorithm can produce the most honest possible, cinema-like simulated surround sound... considering the headset was so average, the end result has been pretty decent, relatively speaking...<br /><br />So I want an upgrade, in a perfect world there would be a DTS master audio dac which uses HDMI 2.0 (HDCP 2.2) passthrough to take the audio and apply DTS headphone x as the surround algorithm to a stereo line out which would then go to my ifi ican to power my mayflower T50rp mk3 version 1.....<br /><br /><b>That&#39;s in &quot;a perfect world&quot;... but what can you suggest as the best quality surround sound dac that&#39;s compatible with PS4...?</b><br /><br />The worst thing is the PS4 doesn&#39;t output audio via USB which narrows my choices so much... I&#39;ve been trying for months to find the right dac, the closest is the Sony HW700DS, it used HDMI like I described but I&#39;m locked into those wireless headphon, I don&#39;t want wireless, and I&#39;m using my t50&#39;s, so... any help appreciated!

Anyone here have any good suggestions? price range ive been looking in is 50-120 euros."}, {"text": "Goal - Find a great headset for competitive gaming. First - I&#39;m not loyal to any brand although I have my preferences. Second - I made my fair deal of researching &amp; I bought the Razer Kraken Chroma - partially because I found them with a huge discount - first hand.<br /><br />   With that being said - I&#39;m like a blind man who truly sees for the first time. I&#39;ve never had a good sound quality experience before and those headphones opened my eyes... or ears.<br />   Sound Quality - top notch. I&#39;ve played certain games for many years &amp; just now I realized that there are so SO many sounds in them, which I&#39;ve never ever heard before. And the ones which I have - quality feels so much better that I can almost touch it.<br />   Microphone - In the hours which followed after I began using the new headset everyone I game with were surprised that they now hear my voice &quot;as if I&#39;m really there right next to them&quot;, which surprised even me (I&#39;m not a commercial sucker). Also the noise cancellation is top notch - my mic never catches anything else except my voice - even when people in the room speak loudly close to me, let alone smaller things like my breathing. And last but not least - the mic is retractable into the headset. You can tilt it in any way you desire. Even when I don&#39;t take it out - it still works 100% for me.<br />   And we&#39;ve arrived at the 7.1 Surround Sound selling point of the headset. Holy sound elementals! This is not a &quot;real&quot; surround sound as in there aren&#39;t 7 drivers on each side of the headset. There&#39;s one big 50mm driver on each side &amp; the surround sound comes from the Razer Synapse 2.0 software. You just need to go through a super quick adjusting process &amp; that&#39;s it. Now when I play Overwatch or Titanfall 2 I can pinpoint exactly where every single sound effect is coming from. I&#39;m fucking able to 180 headshot ppl just because of those headphones &amp; nothing else - won&#39;t even spend time aiming by looking at the person - but by simply relying on the sound. It&#39;s frigin&#39; amazin&#39;!<br />   The only con of these headphones is a pro as well. The cable is braided. Con - whenever the cable rubs against a surface - your sleeve or pants for example, you can head this epicly awful noise in your left ear, which is where the cable goes to. But if you take a few moments to work on your setup, there will be no problem. My cable isn&#39;t touching anything and therefore I don&#39;t have this issue. And this is also a pro obviously because the cable (since it&#39;s braided) is super strong. I myself keep my gaming hardware very safe (for f&#39; sake - I cover it when there&#39;s any resemblance of food or drinks while I&#39;m watching a movie per say), but a fr of mine has a braided cable on his headphones &amp; I&#39;ve seen that cable under his chair&#39;s feet multiple times - still strong after months of usage in such a harsh environment. Obviously my mouse &amp; keyboard are also with a braided cable, so I would always recommend it for any of your gaming gear!<br /><br />   My short review almost sounds like a commercial, I know, but I just love my headphones so much. Oh yeah - they also have RGB lightning effects. Because swag! Goes really well with my Steelseries Apex M800 (as I said - not a brand slave, although my mouse is the old Razer Naga Hex, which was simply the best for my needs at the time).<br />   There could definitely be slightly better headphones for the same price of the Razer Kraken Chroma, but I got them at a 40% discount from an epic sale and I just Adore them!<br /><br />   I&#39;ve listed the most important features a gaming headset needs and this one covers them all with an Ace!"}, {"text": "Sennheiser is best"}, {"text": "i think the gaming headphone companies are working good with their comfort because when ppl play games for hours and hours they take it for consideration.

Sounds are usually flat or the sound is treated in a way that you can easly say where it&#39;s coming from for cost of the sound quality overall. It&#39;s just unbelievable... I was always using regular headphones. There&#39;s a reason to that... They don&#39;t try to show you their shit, they don&#39;t have to suck you with marketing, they simply show what they&#39;ve got. Regular headphones always wanted the clearest sound. At some point they got surrounding sound so you can hear all the instruments around you. It applies to games. You get the clearest sounds, nowadays it&#39;s very easy to tell where the sound is coming from with almost every decent headphones so no need for any muffling so it&#39;s easier to tell or anything. I used quite few headphones. some 2 pairs of panasonic in ancient times, pair of senhaisers, pair of something I couldn&#39;t ever remember, alpha audio HP TWO(they used to be great headphones. bought 2 pairs cus 1st broke and the 3rd one had quality lower than a fucking walkmen earphones) and now I have Kruger&amp;Matz KM665. Holy crap. Those are great. They look great, they have wooden parts for design(and not only), they are VERY comfortable and the sound is so clear... Bass is very noticeable(they say they have specific way of sounding... no... I can agree with that to some extend but no. don&#39;t let that fool ya). It is true that they don&#39;t treat very high Hz very well. When in RHCP scar tissue they play on 12 fret on guitar it doesn&#39;t sound as high as you would imagine but it still sounds great. Low and high sounds are noticeable with more pressure on low sounds.

I mostly sit in my room to do stuff so theres no extra surround sounds messing me up.I tend to do long gaming sessions/work sessions.One more thing : i dont use soundboard on my pc i just directly plug my headsets in to the motherboard, so i notice some hardware interference in krakens which are not pleasant.<br /><br />thanks."}, {"text": "Finally someone decided to put up the most informative video on headphones I have seen to date! Every video so far on how to choose a headphone has been nothing but a shit load of opinions on what the commentator and his buddies like.<br /><br /> but I was still a bit disappointed about the video breezing by the &quot;Real surround sound headphone&quot; topic! u see I own a razer tiamat 7.1, and contrary to all the nay sayers, I learned through a little bit of an enthusiast curiosity that tiamat 7.1 are amazing and extremely under rated headphones.<br /><br />fact is that to date there are only 3 known real 7.1 surround sound headphones (5.1 claim they get more room for bigger drivers but their sound quality was poorer then Tiamat 7.1). Tiamat 7.1 being the archetype for the ASUS Strix 7.1 and G.Skillz Ripjaw SR910. Unfortunately for the other 2 Razer got it right the first time, while the other two face some serious flaws in their implementation. I have heard/read plenty of negative comments on the tiamat 7.1 ranging from, &quot;it&#39;s bass is too boomy&quot; or  &quot;earphones sound better then it&quot; to just plain &quot;Don&#39;t buy it!&quot;. But I did buy it and learned that those who left negative comments on the tiamat 7.1 either did not know how to use a PC sound equilizer setting properly, or did not read the manual for their tiamat 7.1 properly or simply too lazy to get their hands dirty on the PC audio setting interfaces.<br /><br />First, what is real surround sound headphone compared to virtual surround sound headphone? a real surround sound headphone as explained in the video is a headphone that has separate audio channels for drivers in the ear piece of the headphone. for 7.1 each ear piece has 5 drivers making a total of 10 in the headphone, while a 5.1 contains 4 in each ear piece for a grand total of 8 drivers. which ever type u choose they will always have a pair of dedicated bass drivers (meaning those drivers cannot hit high frequency notes) while the rest can easily hit the full upper range of sound frequency. Oh before I get ahead there is another key characteristic of a true surround sound headphone that I should mention: They are completely analog! I am not talking about headphone jacks, I am saying no &quot;dolby prologic II&quot; (used in all virtual surround sound headsets) synthesizing and managing surround sound channels for it. so how do they manage surround channels? that is what ur motherboard sound chip and full PCI sound cards are for. Tiamat 7.1 was designed exactly for this purpose. Instead of altering and mixing surround sound output on a sub standard headphone mounted sound logic chip like the virtual surround sound headphones do, tiamat 7.1 specifically Demands it&#39;s buyers to be prepared to purchase a proper PCI sound card!Once u have done as instructed, u need to spend some time tuning the sound card and counter tuning the headphone volume controller and the result is perfect balance of strong bass, crisp mid range and clear treble!<br /><br />I bought tiamat 7.1 over the other two for certain design reasons:<br /><br />1) ASUS Strix is the most user friendly true surround sound headset. by user friendly I mean it limits users to sound profiles that are preset on it&#39;s sound card box. Yes Asus Strix is Analog and has a sound card housed in a game console like box. In addition it uses an unorthodox HDMI plug on it&#39;s headset and a usb connecting the sound card box to PC. It does not have a software interface for additional options and is entirely dependent on that sound card box for input. If that box was broken  that head phone will be no better then a massive paper weight. plus the lack indepth individual channel sound control made my choice of dropping it easier.<br /><br />2)Ripjaw SR-90 is the new kid on the block, analog like ASUS Strix 7.1 but an even poorer implementation compared to Asus! If the uncomfortable  head  design doesn&#39;t get u the round earpiece turned out to be smaller then required and the drivers are crammed inside it in an arrangement that ruins the directional quality of the sound channels.<br /><br />3) I chose Tiamat 7.1 originally out of curiosity. Ask ur self why a company reputed to be a top gamer choice brand would implement something that sounds like shit? I first plugged it into an onboard sound card and it proved everyone who talked trash about it right! It literally sounded like my fathers old analog radio! No matter what adjustments I did to the motherboard sound chip it did not sound any better. Then I followed the one instruction people have a penchant to ignore: &quot;BUY A GOD DAMN PCI SOUND CARD!&quot;. I bought an old ASUS DSX and put it in my PC. When I fired up the headphone this time it was like fireworks in my ears! The headphones sound profile had changed instantly from absolute trash to platinum brand! ok I might be over stating it! but it&#39;s quality was miles above what it sounded like on an onboard sound chip. Turns out the onboard sound chips do not have enough power to overcome the driver resistance threshold (it is measured in Ohm with the symbol of Omega lets call it the ability to resist work) of each of the 8 normal drivers of the headphone, while the subwoofer drivers have such a low resistance that when the headphone is run on an onboard sound chip it is all bass! switching to a PCI sound card corrected that problem as they are powered separately by the power supply. With a little adjustment to the PCI sound card, the OS System audio setting and the headphone channel volume, It was the best god damn audio headphone I had ever used (not comparing it to the sennheiser audiophile headphones those things are for people with expensive taste in music). After testing the equalizers a bit I concluded that Tiamat 7.1 is an incredible audio chameleon. I had absolute control over how each channel would sound and  each profile gave me a different audio environment in game. All it took was a little effort, getting down and dirty with the system settings, something that true PC enthusiasts are not afraid to do.<br /><br />The surround sound did give me that sudden on/off channel issue mentioned in the video but that is only in a couple of games so far, that problem may have more to do with game developers ignoring audio quality leaving it entirely to virtual synthesizing tools that have hardly been upgraded in the past 15 years! Even the Dolby Pro logic engine that powers all virtual surround sound headphone softwares has not seen an upgrade in 10 years XD. These softwares are prone to calculation errors that make virtual sound quality different from real sound quality. Compared to old games that had immersive 3D sound environments ingame showing their dedication to surround sound systems. game developers today have done very little work in improving surround sound quality and more often  abandon it at the mercy of automated sound synthesizing tools in order to work on visual quality...and yet their games still get a mediocre rating....I wonder why?"}, {"text": "Why the hell is no one dispelling this myth of &quot;surround sound headphones&quot;? Having multiple drivers in your headphones won&#39;t do shit when it comes to locating where a noise comes from. You recognize where a noise comes from based on the volume, but much more importantly, the &quot;lag&quot; between the one ear and the other. When a noise comes from the right of you, the sound enters your right ear earlier than it enters your left ear - and that&#39;s what your brain uses to identify where it&#39;s coming from.

It may sound like a strange setup since the Howard Leight are designed for blocking loud explosive sounds out not listening to music or gaming .  But, after I broke an expensive pair of Sennheiser and broke, lost or had pilfered various other headphones I decided to give them a try.   At first I plugged them in the headphone outlet of my case and they sounded pretty bad (everything was flat and dull).    <br /><br />Out of random one day I plugged them in through the headphone jack of my surround speakers and they sounded amazing.  The speaker jack surprisingly works as a sort of hardware amplifier and mux.  It did a really good job of taking the surround sounds and muxing them out the headphone jack which I tested using various surround sound videos on Youtube.  <br /><br />The Howard leights sound good to me in every category except bass which is just average, but it doesn&#39;t distort which is a good thing.  Depending on the listener the only I noted some may consider bad is that there is a slight white noise effect which I attribute to the hardware amplification/muxing the speakers are doing but this is only noticeable to me when no other sound is coming through.  If you turn the volume knob down on the speakers it goes away but the headphones go back to sound flat and well meh... (IMO the white noise effect is a bonus when using noise canceling headphones)   <br /><br />If you have similar speakers I highly recommend giving it a shot, just be sure to put them in 2/4 speaker mode first if your speakers have that options and disable any speaker fill options your soundcard may have.  I tested this with my soundcard set to 7.1 channels and my speakers switched to 2/4 channel mode.

Ofc i needed a mic, so i got my self a standart mic for 30\u20ac and put it on a small kickstand, the quality of the mic is better as the quality of the most headset mics. The only thing i had to do was an equalizer setting for gaming, so at the end i had spent 70\u20ac and had better quality as gaming headsets for a price of 200\u20ac i had a comparison with a Sennhaiser and Logitec headset for about 180\u20ac and my setting was obv. better, so i wont buy any gaming headsets any more. <br /><br />In my opinion, the companies just try to make a lot of money out of it, because the market is smaller, people always want to get a good gaming headset and only know about that few popular producers like Sennhaiser, Logitech and so on. If you look at the producer in music headphone market, it is insanely more competition there.

I have had several headphones/headsets.<br /><br /> One I had for years and used the mic non-stop was the Creative Fatal1ty You can pick this up for $30, its comfortable, and the mic and sound are clear. Only downside was the durability, the plastic fantastic band is not made to last, but for the price I think its one of the best.<br /><br />My travel headphones are the sony MDR1A which I picked up for $60 (a telecom provider gave them away when you bought a sony headphone, so the marketplace was swarmed with them). Nice sound, nearly unbreakable (handy for travel!). But no mic, so I use the onboard of my laptop (which isn&#39;t to shabby, but it catches the typing sound)<br /><br />In my search for something wireless (no batteries), with mic, and noice canceling for my work, I came across the beats by dre studio wireless. And although beats has a reputation of being overpriced and all about bass and marketing, I found this headphone not that bad. For gaming it&#39;s even awesome, the punchy bass works well. The downside is because the noice canceling, you can&#39;t hear your own voice well, so you tend to yell. Another downside is the buildquality, again the plastic.. Comfortwise and listening experience, this is one of my favorite headphones (I like fun-sound, not this-is-how-its-ment-to-be audiofyl sound). If people are looking for a cheaper alternative, I can recommend the bluedio T2s for only $30 They are almost up to par with beats, and I wish I knew of them before.<br /><br />Now I&#39;m searching for my next headset that works with the Ps4. To bad this video, only looked at pc gaming headphones, For ps4 it&#39;s not an option to have seperate mic (I think) Or would a clipon mic (in the controller) with a normal headphone (wireless or connected through usb in the ps4) work?

For online gaming I attached a 4\u20ac Genius mic-01microphone to the wire that sounds... surprisingly good for the price. Tried several 5-10\u20ac mics and they are the best, by far. I&#39;m not an audiophile, but I can easily tell the difference between a crappy and a decent sound, and while I&#39;m not a basshead I enjoy the bass. To me, the ATH-M50x produce a very enjoyable sound. Soundstage is not that bad, It could be better, but meets my expectations. On the other hand, thanks to the closed back bass sounds deep, punchy, but tight and never becomes too overwhelming. Comfort depends a lot on user preferences, but I have to say that they could be more comfy. To me, they are a little bit too small for being on-ear and, after almost 2 years of almost daily usage, the earpads are not as soft and padded as they used to be. Overall, I really like my ATH-M50x. Maybe one day I will buy a Superlux HD-668 B, just because I heard a lot of good things about them and, damn, they&#39;re so inexpensive it&#39;s worth the try.<br /><br />For portable gaming and listening to music at the office or traveling I use Dunu Titan 1 IEMs, which are just amazing. I could never imagine a sub-200\u20ac IEMs could sound like that until I tried them. The highs are a little too crisp with the default eartips, but with proper tips (comply foam or silicone, it&#39;s up to you) you can adjust the sound signature to your personal preferences. I liked the most the comply tips, but for casual listening at the office taking the foam tips in and out can become really annoying, that&#39;s why I&#39;m using the blue-ish silicon ones that came with the Titan. Don&#39;t expect a on-ear sound quality coming from IEMs, they&#39;re a completely different thing. But, knowing what they are, and for the price tag, the Dunu Titan 1 are a 10/10."}, {"text": "<b>Buy hyperX cloud 2 it&#39;s a really really good headset</b>"}, {"text": "not gonna lie bruh, but that headphone head turn intro edit you did was cool af!!!"}, {"text": "What about wireless headphones? do you suggest them? can you tell me at least 2 wireless headphones to  buy?

For example someone who as some hearing loss in the upper frequencies might not think a certain headphones is too bright or shrill due to hearing loss while for someone else it is like sticking needles in their ear.Also saying something like Sennheisers are crap or the best are just opinions.Not only are they just opinions they are both blanket statements.Personally I have heard Sennheisers that I loved and some that I thought were okay and even some that I thought were garbage and this was regardless of price.My point is that your headphone listening solutions might be best for you but they might not be the best for others."}, {"text": "i dont like big headphones because why :<br />1.so heavy<br />2.my eat sweat"}, {"text": "I rock those AKG K701, love them for gaming.

I did a thesis on DSP and stereo convolution reverb, simulating the sound of a space in 2channels. So with the whole 7.2 vs 2ch headphones. Game engines use something called binaural processing, this is where the game uses a mix of EQ, delays and some other fancy dsp stuff to simulate how the human ear pics up sound, and to trick your brain\u2019s psycho acoustic functions into perceiving direction. It is optimised for 2ch, (1 speaker for each ear). At the same time the game also renders the sound for 7.2, 5.2, ext\u2026 7.1 in a home theatre the speakers are far away so they can work together to give the feeling that your wearing headphones, when the speakers are close you notice the sounds moving between speakers like you said. 7.2 headphones only make sense in a professional 7.1 situation, where an engineer would want to mix for a movie but may not have access to 7 speakers and a sub; though I don\u2019t know may engineers that do this. Games are made for this binaural processing, if it\u2019s meat to sound punchy in game, its meant to sound punchy in binaural. Some engines also allow you to turn off a specific sound\u2019s binaural processing so it\u2019s really in your face front and centre. I think what you got confused with, is when gaming headphones have \u201cGaming enhanced sound\u201d. These are EQs and compressors that run as DSP, and they destroy the sound quality, but some of them are modelled after the headphones soldiers use in combat, they cut out frequencies that aren\u2019t gunshots, footsteps and voice so you only hear the important stuff.

Virtual surround sound, crossfeed, and binaural recordings all work on the same principle, which is that if you create a difference between the two ears,  you change the positioning. This is done by EQ and delay, but the main thing is that the perception comes from the difference between the two ears, not the change itself. In the case of virtual surround sound, you lose soundstage width, but you gain an extra dimension, the front-back plane. So it is important to start out with headphones that naturally are wide like the sennheiser hd800. Since it is done in the digital domain, you can use virtual surround sound with any headphones. An interesting thing people do is use the optical output from a xonar dgx with dolby headphone, pass it through to an optical dac like the audioengine d1, and then use that to power the headphones of their choice."}, {"text": "Play PC games.

On a side note, it handles dual audio channels, one from wireless my pc, and the other from my xbox quite well. As I am able to use Teamspeak and play my xbox as well as listen to music off my pc all at the same time without any distortion, permitting I dont mess with the 3.5mm cable too much lol. I will say that I was very disappointed in the battery life of this headset when I first got it. They stated it had up to 8 hours of battery life at full charge, which I believed to be true considering my history with the g930&#39;s was about that. But theyd start dying within 4-5 hours of gaming. Now this was easily fixed by turning off the rgb LED&#39;s on the headset, I did however leave logitech G symbol on and set to red to my my system.

I had bought a Turtle Beach X12 (bought for $30) to use for my Xbox 360 back in 2013, and I decided that I would go ahead and use them as a replacement headset. At first, I thought they sounded pretty bad, but after finding out an issue regarding the USB power module and fixing it, they sounded amazing. The microphone on the X12 was, in my opinion, better than the G35s. Unfortunately, my X12s started to break a couple of weeks ago so I replaced it with the Recon 60p (bought for $39.99) and I feel like the Recon 60p sounded better (both microphone and driver-wise) and was more comfortable than the significantly more expensive Logitech G35s.<br />But that&#39;s just my opinion.<br />If anyone wants to hear a mic test or something of the Recon 60p. you can look it up, or, alternatively, I&#39;m going to upload a cute little review soon, so that can be viewed."}, {"text": "What&#39;s with the hate for all the flashy stuff?

So: $200 (US) for the K7XX. My personal recommendation as far as amps go would be the Schiit Magni 2 which will run you about $100. Then if you want the Modmic as well, that would go for another $40. So your total is around $380 or so (including tax so more or less some). Seriously though, if one does consider a real pair of headphones, as you definitely should since they are absolutely amazing, you need to factor in the price of the amp as well. Amps breath life into the headphones and give them clear power. The k7XX are notoriously difficult to power. If you want to skimp out on the amp a bit another viable company would be Fiio. They&#39;re not that great but for the price they&#39;re definitely good. But yea, the amp itself needs attention. A shit amp makes shit sound.

Then they broke and I bought the stealth 450 that i am currently using, and although drivers are SHIT from turtulebeach and they always be, the headphones are surprisingly good, they do get really loud too, 7.1 is much better than in the z300 that I loved already and the battery OMG they still have an amazing battery and I just hate charging all day and these well, last for like a week of gaming and movie/video watching it is amazing.<br /><br />Obviously audio quality is not the best, specially in the z300 audio quality was garbage even after EQ it sounded like cheap-o drivers inside a coca cola can... but the stealth 450 I have to say, has some really good sound that I even use to edit video because of how flat it is. But, obviously for music listening I have a separate pair of wired headphones although those only have 40mm drivers and the stealth are a 50mm driver.. and I really love them because of that. If someone can make a good quality driver that can deliver not just good quality but good positional audio then I am all for it, but, in reality when GAMING you don&#39;t need that super crisp  audio, specially in chaotic games like FPS where there is always really loud noises going on from EVERYWHERE...

The EQ customization is awesome, I got it to sound exactly how I wanted it too. The only issue I have with this headset is the build, it&#39;s all plastic, and it got loose very fast.

The headphones are also very comfortable with their big plush earpads and the extremely nice floating headband thing.<br />On top of that, they are also incredibly well built with nice materials and great attention to detail. It&#39;s some true craftsmanship.<br />They are only 30 Ohms, meaning that they are easy to drive so you can straight up use them with your phone or DAP. <br />And to top it all off, the 3.5 mm cable (the nicest one I have ever seen, even better than the V-Moda ones) is removable, meaning that you can plug a V-Moda Boompro into the headphones. <br />That&#39;s what I did, so now I have amazing headphones for both music and gaming, that I can make into a headset with a great microphone whenever I want to. <br /><br />If you are looking for a gaming headset and you have a budget of around 300 dollars or euros or something equivalent, this is the way to go!<br />For music I can totally recommend these X2s as well, I love them for it, but that is even more subjective then the gaming part so for that I would say do some deep research as to what is perfect for you.
