[{"text": "Thank you for this beautiful recital in your beautiful venue. What great students. Could you please tell me the name of the Burgm\u00fcller piece? Thank you."}, {"text": "Wow la campanella\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d"}, {"text": "What a delightful concert ! Loved just about everything. Had never listened to these sweet Beethoven Variations. Always love these Mozart A Major Variations. The Waldstein was great. It&#39;s a real challenge to stay the distance with this almost continuous velocity. And he made it.  The Campanella is a daunting assault course and he went through it with flying colors. Had never known about  Libermann. This Gargoyles has a nice Prokofiev feel. In a word it was great and congratulations to Ruo Huang !"}, {"text": "Hi Jane I was nice to be able to see you for once, as opposed to just your hands on the keyboard.  All of those kids were incredible and their talent impressive. I particularly liked Josetta&#39;s performance, she clearly had prepared herself well in terms of her appearance and had a delicacy of touch and execution that was truly professional. I am sure will continue on to do well in her musical career.  Jeffery&#39;s performance was powerful and well executed, his maturity shone through during the difficult passages It&#39;s great to see these youngsters participating and confidently engaging so well with classical music. Thank you giving them your support and encouragement. \u221a"}, {"text": "What a wonderful recital!  Congratulations to all the participants.
