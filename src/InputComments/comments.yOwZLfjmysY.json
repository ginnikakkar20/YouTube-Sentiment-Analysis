Most of the time it is upscaled 4k.<br /><br />A TV behind 50&quot; for the living room does not worth it, and the price for a 4k TV is over 2000.<br />For PC, you want IPS and 27&quot; and over freesync. Its is at least 700$ + a pc with two GTX980 that will cost you one leg but you will still not be able to play at 60fps on demanding games.<br /><br />So definitly, 4K is a very bad investment for now.
