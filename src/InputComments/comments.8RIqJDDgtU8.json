I\u2019m newbie , where should I start from, which videos should I start watching in order to learn algorithms ?"}, {"text": "You are my inspiration.Please keep uploading your <a href=\"http://videos.it/\">videos.It</a> helps me understand how to  approach a problem"}, {"text": "I am a huge fan of you sir!"}, {"text": "If you teach me how to code then I will work for free for you"}, {"text": "Please make a video on Leetcode problem 407."}, {"text": "Can you also upload live coding of CF rounds after contest are over"}, {"text": "Errichto, should I Solve leetcode for interview preparation?"}, {"text": "When will be the next streaming?"}, {"text": "His coding logic is so clear.

Legend."}, {"text": "Thanks a lot for this, this kind of video is really helpful"}, {"text": "You rock dude!!"}, {"text": "I wonder how good you are at DP you imagine them so quickly and dimensions and dp equations. Someday I aspire to be as fast as you. Till then continue streaming about Dynamic programming."}, {"text": "Very Nice! I saved the problems on Leet Code. If I have some issues (for sure I will) I will come to this video!"}, {"text": "This video really helps. Thanks!"}]
