The shift button takes some getting used to, since you click it into the mouse instead of the table.<br />Tyon pro: Binding something like windows volume to shift+mousewheel up/down is something i almost cant live without. You can actually comfortably click shift and the other buttons on the top.<br />The extra 4 buttons on the side of the normal left and right click is so perfect, i really only use one of the ones on the right side, because pressing them down is tricky for my fingers, but when im on other mice, i keep wanting them there too. This is not a good travel mouse, if it falls down, the flippy button on the side easily gets broken, but while it lasts, its genious, i bound it to my most used skill in wow, and it&#39;s so natural to press.<br />Do mind that the other thumb buttons can be shift+x bound, but your thumb is busy holding the shfit key down, so the only way to click them is with a pinch manouver with your pointer  finger."}, {"text": "This Video I like so much!"}, {"text": "Had a G502 for a year.

There are varying levels of quality and precision in each category and in most cases, price will dictate the quality features. So, in summary, they are all good, but good is relevant only to the application and person driving the mouse. For gamers, accuracy, precision, speed, button placement, laser vs optical the list goes on. Buy one and you&#39;ll want the features of another, that&#39;s how it works and they all just keep getting better optics with more and more features but at a price. So pick one that suits your needs and fits your hands, and remember, they&#39;re all pretty darned good mice and they are only as good as the person using it. Great video Dmitri!!

Everyone that has one seems to swear by it but I think the lack of including buttons being dispersed between your 5 fingers is a bad design as it limits response time due to high volume of buttons under one finger. To each their own, I guess.<br /><br />Worth mentioning is the Steel Series WoW Cataclysm Mouse. Large array of buttons all spread out very nicely across all the buttons to allow for button combinations as well as better response time due to multiple fingers ready to execute a series of button presses. It has 11 extra buttons (making 14 in total with left click, right click, and middle mouse click). Left click and right click both contain a single button to each side, making a |0|^|0| configuration with | being a button, 0 left/right click and ^ middle mouse. There is also a single button behind middle mouse as well and another single button on the far right side. The last 5 buttons are under the thumb with three being vertical and two on top horizontal. Just google the mouse if you are still confused. It is slightly heavy and bigger than most mouse but still has an ergonomic design to it.<br /><br />The UI for the button customization is for WoW and is all given by in game action as opposed to actual keyboard press and even follow the same press style (single press 95% of the actions and Press/Hold on the WASD + QE (movement and strafe) keys only.) The macro commands are scripted for WoW software so will not be accepted by other games. You will have to find the in game action related to that key press and bind that action to the key you want in order to say bind L to Mouse Button 12 you have to bind &quot;Quest Log&quot; to M12. Other than that, it has 10 profiles that you can have and even store a profile on the mouse as well as have profiles linked to specific characters in WoW so when you log in that one it will load the profile automatically. It can be worked around for any game, a bit of a hassle to due but still possible. If you want a mouse specific to WoW then the Steel Series WoW Cataclysm Mouse is 100% the best mouse you can have and will improve your gaming experience.<br /><br />I have the Logtiech G502 Proteus Core Mouse for FPS style games, since they require less extra buttons and I like the snipe button.

I am 1.90 m (6 foot 2) tall and, although I have short fingers in comparison with my height, my palms are pretty wide and this mouse is TOO NARROW (although long enough) for me. And that&#39;s a BIG bummer, because the mouse is actually PERFECT in any other respect. The fact that it offers INCREDIBLE customization (I, for example, have a &quot;night&quot; profile on which I&#39;ve set the default DPI-change buttons to adjust the sound volume and the left and right scroll-wheel tilts to change de DPI), along with the ingenious weight distribution system and its already hefty weight (128 - 145 grams) makes this the mouse I will truly regret (yes, I am seriously thinking about getting a new, wider one).<br /><br />I would suggest watching more detailed reviews, as the customization options DO NOT end here and, if you have average-sized hands, it would actually be a shame to miss such a perfectly-crafted mouse that&#39;s going to satisfy your every single need.<br /><br />Build-quality is of the highest standards.<br /><br />Buttons feel perfect in every way, aside from the scroll-wheel (see below).<br /><br />The scroll-wheel is a little weird, it vibrates in the mouse&#39;s shell and the middle click is mostly uncomfortable and insecure.<br /><br />Other than its size (which is a personal issue) and the scroll-wheel (which will surely bother most people), this mouse is a work of art, very carefully thought out, built out of quality materials, exceptional tracking, good looks and everything.<br /><br />PS: If changing its lighting colors really matters to you, know that this mouse does NOT offer that type of support, the only available color being teal (blue-ish). You can, however, increase or decrease its light and breathing effect levels in tens of increments, which is nice.<br /><br />I hope this helps but, again, you should watch more detailed reviews because there&#39;s a lot more about it than what I&#39;ve mentioned here, and it&#39;s all good stuff.<br /><br />Cheers!"}, {"text": "I use my trackpad for professional FPS"}, {"text": "Logitec mx 518 optical,still the best because its practical,costs little and comfortable.

To make them less of a strain to reach the back buttons, they should have all been decreased in size and pushed forward.<br /><br />However I did find myself liking the weights, I found that if I added 2 weights, one at the back and one of the left it increased by accuracy.<br /><br />Contrastingly I found that the massive DPI of 12,000 and the &quot;sniper&quot; button (slows down mouse speed while holding it down) are both gimmicks, I never found myself using either. Unless I had a 5K resolution that needed high DPI I may consider it, but even 12,000 DPI is too high then. The &quot;sniper&quot; button actually made it <i>harder</i> to shoot accurately, instead you&#39;d have to adjust quickly to the slower speed, while putting your finger in a awkward position to hold it down.<br /><br />In heinsight I would have gone for a minimalist mouse, with less crap involved and no software."}, {"text": "I LOVE my Logitech G502"}, {"text": "I found one better and for only $40 (the Redragon Perdition)"}, {"text": "Years and years ago when i played savage 1 and fear combat, i had my ancient logitech PS/2 optical mouse which came with the computer.

In comparison, a Saitek MMO7 costs roughly $170 USD locally.<br /><br />Layout:<br />2 main buttons, a clicking scroll wheel (no side tilts), and 11 macro-able buttons<br /><br />Aesthetics:<br />Subjective. I personally hate the appearance of it, however some may like it (especially if you&#39;re into WoW). I&#39;ve owned / own a fair few beautiful looking mice (some Zowie models, some Saitek models), and this doesn&#39;t have the material quality or finish that others do.<br /><br />Build quality (YMMV):<br />It has stood up to 3 years of punishment. In the 1.5 years prior, I broke 2 Naga&#39;s and 4 Saitek MMO7&#39;s. The WoW Cata buttons still click reliably, however some of the paint looks quite horrible now.<br /><br />Performance:<br />Tracking is based on a medicre laser sensor. Do not use this mouse for FPS titles or Moba skill shots. Macro performance is great; hardware level profiles can be saved to on-board memory so that you don&#39;t need any software installed. The software macro tools are quite in-depth and allow for precise timings and various levels of automation. Macro&#39;s can also be tied directly to WoW, with in-built preset macros that are based off pre-existing keybinds you&#39;ve made in the client (eg: you can set a programmable button to &#39;use [specific skill]&#39;, or &#39;target focus target&#39; without manually specifying which keybind you have set to use that specific skill or which keybind you&#39;ve bound to target focus target).<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />If you want a cheap, indestructable mouse for MMO gaming, that excels in the areas that matter to the genre (reliability and programability), it seems like a solid choice."}, {"text": "What about the G700s?
