You make new bolts instead of using new hardware because of the zinc plating. Could you have stripped the zinc using a bit of sulfuric acid in water to strip the zinc then simply blue the bolts then? I did this when I cad-plated some misc parts for my 1968 Charger.<br /><br /><br />2. What helps you determine whether to blue hardware vs. heating it and quenching it in oil to blacken it? I have seen you do both processes in your videos and just wondered what guidance you use to determine which is better in a given situation. <br /><br /><br /><br />3.
