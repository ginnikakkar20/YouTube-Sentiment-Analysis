Let&#39;s say the time limit is huge, like 50 seconds :D<br />And the constraint for a[i] in GCD problem is actually 10^12, not 10^5.", "Thank you, Kamil! I liked the video a lot and I&#39;m looking forward the next part of the lecture! :)", "Can you talk about the Simulated annealing next time?", "Hi, I&#39;m so glad to see you do what you&#39;re doing and I want you do very well so excuse me for this unsolicited advice: Maybe it would help you to go to a voice coach, or an average logopeda ;) ? I know it helped me a lot and it would give you a boost not just on youtube, it gave my Charisma +3. It&#39;s unbelievable how ppl want to listen to you and hang around you more if you hv a great command of your voice.", "can you make a tutorial video from scratch", "I took a whole grad course on randomized algorithms and all I learned was chebyshev, this is much better!", "For Line through N/4 problem, do we check for each ~200 pair of points the number of points on the same line? So O(200n) = O(n) and take the line with maximum number of points?", "Thank you so much for your videos. Please keep making videos. You are helping out a lot of people. Cheers !!", "Hey amazing video scholar!!", "Just wanted a suggestion from you:<br />Would you change your entire approach towards a question if you don&#39;t get the correct solution (even when you know there is a slight change required) or try to find that small mistake when in a competition?", "at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r2D32esF3Y&amp;t=14m49s\">14:49</a> after the observation of skipping last character ,isn&#39;t it should be (1 + 2 + 3 )/3 instead of (1 + 2 + 3 + 3)/4  as we have skipped last char and maximum query  we gonna ask is 3 ? <br />please reply...", "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r2D32esF3Y&amp;t=19m45s\">19:45</a> seemed like you are talking about reverse engineering a trading algorithm", "Very interesting lecture<br />Keep it up!", "I always wanted a tutorial on randomized algorithms. Thank You", "i absolutely adore randomized algorithm!
